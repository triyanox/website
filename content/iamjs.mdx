As web applications evolve and grow in complexity, the need for advanced security measures also increases. One particular area of focus is the authorization process, which controls who has access to what within an application. But how do you manage this efficiently?

Introducing iamjs, a robust, performance-driven authorization library engineered to streamline your authorization process through a schema-based approach. Composed of several modules such as @iamjs/core, @iamjs/express, @iamjs/koa, @iamjs/next and @iamjs/react, iamjs has something to accommodate a variety of programming environments.

## 🎉 **Features:**

**iamjs** is a feature-rich access control library that offers high performance and a wide range of capabilities. It revolutionizes the authorization process by empowering developers with efficient tools that simplify their workflow. Here are some key features that make **iamjs** stand out:

- 🧪 Effortless Testing: **iamjs** is equipped with comprehensive testing tools that simplify the process of validating your authorization logic. This feature ensures that your application remains secure throughout development, giving you peace of mind.

## 🧠 **@iamjs/core:**

The `@iamjs/core` module provides the core logic for the library, empowering developers with a toolkit that makes building access control systems a simpler task.

For instance, let's begin by defining two roles, `user` and `admin`, both equipped with specific permissions for different actions and resources:

```ts
import { AuthManager, Role, Schema } from "@iamjs/core";

const roles = {
  user: new Role({
    name: "user",
    config: {
      user: {
        scopes: "-r--l",
        custom: {
          ban: false,
        },
      },
      post: {
        scopes: "crudl",
        custom: {
          publish: true,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
  admin: new Role({
    name: "admin",
    config: {
      user: {
        scopes: "crudl",
        custom: {
          ban: true,
        },
      },
      post: {
        scopes: "crudl",
        custom: {
          publish: true,
        },
      },
    },
  }),
};

const schema = new Schema(roles);
const auth = new AuthManager(schema);
```

With the roles and authorization schema defined, you can now utilize the AuthManager class to perform authorization checks effortlessly:

```ts
const isAdminAuthorized = auth.authorize({
  role: "admin",
  actions: ["ban", "create"],
  resources: "user",
}); // true

const isUserAuthorized = auth.authorize({
  role: "user",
  actions: ["read", "create"],
  resources: ["post", "user"],
  strict: true,
}); // false
```

## **🚀 @iamjs/express:**

For Express.js enthusiasts, `@iamjs/express` provides seamless integration with the Express.js framework. Leveraging this module, you can easily set up middleware for assigning roles and checking authorization, amplifying your application's security layer in just a few lines of code:

```ts
import { Role, Schema } from '@iamjs/core';
import { ExpressRoleManager } from '@iamjs/express';
import express from 'express';

const role = new Role({
  name: 'role',
  config: {
    resource1: {
      scopes: 'crudl'
    },
    resource2: {
      scopes: 'cr-dl',
      custom: {
        'create a new user': false
      }
    }
  }
});

const schema = new Schema({
  role
});

const roleManager = new ExpressRoleManager({
  schema: schema,
  onError(_err, _req, res, _next) {
    res.status(403).send('Forbidden');
  },
  onSucess(_req, res, _next) {
    res.status(200).send('Hello World from the success handler!');
  }
});

const app = express();

app.get(
  '/resource1',
  roleManager.check({
    resources: 'resource1', // the resources to be accessed
    actions: ['create', 'update'], // the actions to be performed
    role: 'role',// the role to check
    strict: true // make the checks run in strict mode
    // additionnaly you can construct role from permissions by using the construct option
		construct: true,
		data: async(req){
			return schema.get('role').toObject()
		}
}),
  (_req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
  }
);

```

## ☢️ **@iamjs/react:**

Finally, weaving this into a React setting, `@iamjs/react` simplifies checking permissions within your components. It introduces a nifty hook - `useAuthorize`, allowing you to control component rendering based on user roles:

Import `useAuthorize` and `createSchema` from the package

```tsx
import { Role } from "@iamjs/core";
import { createSchema, useAuthorization } from "@iamjs/react";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
```

Create the initial schema with a default roles

```tsx
const schema = createSchema({
  user: new Role({
    name: 'user',
    description: 'User role',
    meta: {
      name: 'user'
    },
    config: {
      books: {
        scopes: 'crudl',
        custom: {
          upgrade: true,
          downgrade: false,
          sort: true
        }
      }
    }
  })

```

Create your own hook to fetch the user's permissions from your backend

```tsx
const useUser = () => {
  const { build } = useAuthorization(schema);
  const [userRole, setUserRole] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Call the API endpoint to fetch user permissions
    fetch("/permssions")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        // Build the role based on the received permissions
        const builtRole = build(data);
        setUserRole(builtRole);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching user permissions:", error);
      });
  }, []);

  return userRole;
};
```

Use your own hook to check the permissions or to check the user's permissions or render components conditionally

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  const userRole = useUser();

  if (!userRole) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  const { can, Show } = userRole;

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{can("books", "create").toString()}</div>
      <Show resources="books" actions="create">
        <div>Rendered if user has 'create' permission for 'books'</div>
      </Show>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Additionally your use the `Show` and `can` methods directly from `useAuthorize` and use the roles you provided in the schema to render conditionally or check the users permissions

```tsx
const { can, Show } = useAuthorization(schema);

const canDo = can("user", "books", "create").toString(); // 'true'

<Show role="user" resources="books" actions="create">
  <div>can show</div>
</Show>;
```
