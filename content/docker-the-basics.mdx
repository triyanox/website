In this blog post we will going to talk about the basics of Docker and Containers.

## Docker

Docker is a containerization technology that allows you to run applications on a virtual machine.
When you're deploying an application the old way you're using a virtual machine on the cloud or on your own hardware, and inside
this virtual machine you're running the application with the required runtime and dependencies and additional libraries, but with this way
of doing things you're using a lot of resources, and at scale you're going to have a lot of these virtual machines running at the same time, so
you will going to have lot of scalability issues.
And that were docker comes to the rescue.

Essentially, Docker to replicate environments using containers.
To make a container you will need an image, which is a bleuprint of the container you want to create, to simplify things an image is like a class
and you will use this class to create multiple instances of the same container.

And using Docker you don't have to deal with all the junk added by virtualized operating systems that may consume a lot of resources,
and you can be free of the **worked on my machine syndrome** , and you can easlly create the environment needed to run your application.

## Dockerfile

To create this images we talked about you will need a Dockerfile, which is a file that describes the steps to create the image.
To create this Dockerfile simply create a file called Dockerfile in the root of your project, and write the steps you want to follow to create an image for your application.

## Create an image

To build your first image clone this repo by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/triyanox/flask-docker-boilerplate.git
```

This is just a simple server made with Flask, and it's a simple example of how to create an image.
In the root folder you will find the main application

```py:app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "hello world This is Mohamed Achaq!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')

```

and the Dockerfile

```:Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8.9-alpine
RUN pip install flask
COPY app.py /app.py
CMD ["python","app.py"]
```

The Dockerfile is made of layers of commands, and the layers run in order from top to bottom, so it's a better practice to make sure that the commands that maight change frequently are at the bottom of the Dockerfile to take advantage of caching.

in this Dockerfile we have the following layers or commands:

- FROM python:3.8.9-alpine:
  This were your Dockerfile will start executing from. Every Dockerfile must start with a **FROM** line that is the starting image to build your layers on top of. In this case, we are selecting the Python 3.8.9-alpine image.
  Alpine means that it uses the alpine distribution, which is significantly smaller than an alternative flavor of Linux. A smaller image means it will download (deploy) much faster, and it also has advantages for security because it has a smaller attack surface.

- RUN pip install flask
  This is a command that will install the Flask library on your image.
  And the **RUN** command is a command that will executes commands needed to set up your image for your application, such as installing packages, editing files, or changing file permissions.
- COPY app.py /app.py
  This is a command that will copy the app.py file to the /app.py file inside the image.
  The **COPY** command is a command that will copy files from one location to another.
- CMD ["python","app.py"]
  This is a command that will execute the app.py file inside the image.
  The **CMD** command is a command that will execute a command in the image.

## Build an image

Before going any further you need to install Docker on your machine.

To build your image you need to run the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker build -t flask-docker-boilerplate .
```

Then verify that the image was created by running the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker image ls
```

## Run an image

To run this image you need to run the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker run -p 3000:5000 flask-docker-boilerplate
```

First let's discuss this command.
**docker run** is a command that will run a Docker image.
we use the **-p** flag to tell Docker to expose a port on the host machine to the container.
**3000** is the port that we want to expose on the host machine, and **5000** is the port that we want to expose on the container.

Now head over to your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ and you should see the following message:

```html:html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>hello world This is Mohamed Achaq!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Check out the logs of the container

To check out the logs of the container you need to run the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker container log flask-docker-boilerplate
```

## DockerHub

[Docker Hub website](https://hub.docker.com/) is a website that allows you to share your Docker images with the community, and this type of services known as **registries** or **central registries**, and you can integrate them in you CI/CD
pipeline just like you integrate your GitHub repository.

To push your image to Docker Hub you need to follow the following steps:

### Create a Docker Hub account

First head over to the [Docker Hub website](https://hub.docker.com/) create an account .

### Login to Docker Hub

Then you need to login to Docker Hub by running the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker login
```

Then you will be asked to enter your username and password.

### Tag your image

Then you need to tag your image with the name of your project and the version of your application.

```bash:terminal
docker tag flask-docker-boilerplate [your_docker_hub_username]/flask-docker-boilerplate:latest
```

### Push your image to Docker Hub

Finally you need to push your image to Docker Hub.

```bash:terminal
docker push [your_docker_hub_username]/flask-docker-boilerplate:latest
```

## Deploy changes

Let's change the message on the page to "hello world" from "hello world This is Mohamed Achaq!".

```py {5-11}:app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "hello world !"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')

```

Then rebuild the image by using the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker build -t flask-docker-boilerplate .
```

Then push the image to Docker Hub by using the following command:

```bash:terminal
docker push [your_docker_hub_username]/flask-docker-boilerplate:latest
```

## Caching mechanism

Docker images have a caching mechanism that allows them to be cached on the host machine, and this mechanism is used to speed up the deployment of your application.
Remember the layers of commands that are at the bottom of the Dockerfile?
Everytime you commit a change to those commands you will not going to rebuild the image from scratch but instead you will be using the cached image and the changes will be applied to the cached image.
